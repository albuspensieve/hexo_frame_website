  title: Ching Jin ｜Assistant Professor
  subtitle: Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies | University of Warwick
  body: "I am a computational social scientist, who specializes in developing novel computational methodologies by leveraging tools from network science, statistical physics, and artificial intelligence. My work involves applying these methods to large-scale datasets across various domains, including technology, science, and commerce, with the overarching goal of describing, modeling, and predicting social patterns.
    \n\n
   My research has resulted in five academic journal publications, including first-authored papers in Nature Human Behaviour (featured on the cover) and Nature Communications. Additionally, my work has been covered in media outlets such as Harvard Business Review and Science Daily.
   \n\n
   I am currently an Assistant Professor in Data Science at CIM (Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies) at the University of Warwick. I earned my PhD in Physics from Northeastern University, under the supervision of Prof. Dashun Wang and Professor Albert-László Barabási. Following my doctoral studies, I served as a postdoctoral researcher at the Kellogg School of Management and held the role of Associate Director at the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO), both at Northwestern University, under the guidance of Professor Brian Uzzi."
