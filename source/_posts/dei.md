Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) are vital for increasing and sustaining creativity in scientific research. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of gender disparity within the field of economics, utilizing a large-scale dataset encompassing 2 million publication records and the professional interactions of over 900,000 economists. Our analysis reveals significant underrepresentation of women among prize winners and in important roles such as journal editors. The data suggest that this imbalance may be attributed to biased collaboration, resource allocation, and gender-based homophily in networking. Furthermore, we construct a mathematical modeling framework to link Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the academic system. Our findings highlight persistent gender biases and offer insights into their possible origins, providing a substantive foundation for policy implications aimed at fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion in science.
